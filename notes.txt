when you want to compile the application into a mac app use this in the terminal:
make
/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/bin/macdeployqt SynapseVisionLab.app
codesign --force --deep --sign - SynapseVisionLab.app

Plans for the app:

1. Advanced File Handling
Batch processing - Load multiple files at once

Recent files list - Quick access to recently opened files

File info panel - Display metadata (sampling rate, recording duration, number of events, etc.)

Export to multiple formats - MAT, EDF+, BrainVision, etc.

2. Event/Marker Support
Event markers - Display stimulus/response markers on the chart

Event table - List all events with timestamps and types

Event editing - Add, remove, or modify events

Epoch extraction - Extract time-locked epochs around events

3. Advanced Visualization
Spectrograms - Time-frequency representation

Topographic maps - 2D/3D scalp topography (requires electrode locations)

PSD plots - Power spectral density visualization

Overlay mode - Overlay multiple channels or conditions

Color customization - User-selectable channel colors

Grid customization - Adjustable grid spacing and appearance

4. Signal Processing Enhancements
ICA/PCA - Independent/Principal Component Analysis for artifact removal

Wavelet denoising - Wavelet-based noise reduction

Baseline correction - Remove baseline drift

Resampling - Change sampling rate

Channel interpolation - Repair bad channels

Reference schemes - More montage options (CAR, REST, etc.)

5. Artifact Detection & Removal
Automatic artifact detection:

Eye blink detection

Muscle artifact detection

Electrode pop detection

Saturation/clipping detection

Artifact rejection - Remove or interpolate bad segments

Artifact marking - Visually mark artifacts in the chart

6. Analysis Tools
ERP analysis - Average across trials, plot grand averages

Frequency analysis - FFT, band power calculations

Connectivity measures - Coherence, correlation between channels

Peak detection - Automatic detection of peaks/features

Export statistics - CSV export of all measurements

7. Scripting/ Automation
MATLAB-like scripting - Simple script editor for batch processing

Pipeline saving - Save and load processing pipelines

Command-line interface - Headless processing for automation

8. User Interface Improvements
Dockable windows - Fully customizable workspace

Workspace layouts - Save/load UI arrangements

Dark/light themes - Multiple color themes

Keyboard shortcuts - Comprehensive shortcut system

Tooltips - Helpful hints for all controls

Progress indicators - Better feedback for long operations

9. Data Management
Channel grouping - Group channels by region (frontal, central, etc.)

Channel renaming - User-defined channel labels

Channel notes/annotations - Add notes to channels

Data browser - Browse and preview multiple files

10. Clinical/Research Features
Clinical reports - Generate PDF reports with findings

Compliance with standards - EDF+ compliance, BIDS format support

Montage templates - Predefined montages for common setups (10-20 system)

Impedance monitoring - Track electrode impedance over time
